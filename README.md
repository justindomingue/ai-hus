# COMP 424 - Artificial Intelligence

> Term project: building an agent to play the game of Hus.

- **My best player**. Monte-Carlo tree search
- **Other players**. Alpha-Beta pruning and variants of Alpha-Beta pruning

The TAs provided the code to interact with the game board and play moves. My code is in ``/src/student_player``.

To learn the weights of the evaluation function, I used my own ML library available on [Github](https://github.com/justindomingue/ml).
